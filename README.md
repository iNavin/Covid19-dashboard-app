# Covid19-dashboard-app
It is a Covid19 dashboard app that displays the static csv data regarding Covid19 of various countries and states of India. The app is designed to provide insights from data provided by the government inistitutions tp the users using various various data visualization techniques such as graphs and pie charts. The app also builds a cache Sql lite database from the static csv file that so as to improve the fetching speed.

The Covid19 data for the different countries are downloaded from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report?select=covid_19_clean_complete.csv

The Covid19 data for different states of India are downloaded from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-india?select=covid_19_india.csv

The only problem with this app is that I am not able to dynamically change the data so as to get new data, in order to get new data you have download the Data files and then again rebuild the project.
